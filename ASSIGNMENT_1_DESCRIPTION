LOGO DESIGN
To recreate the attached logo for this recruitment process, I have used a simple method, that is, PowerPoint. I used basic shapes(rectangles and squares)from the insert menu and manipulated them according to my needs. When coming to the colors, I used the eyedropper tool to pic the appropriate colors according to the logo provided and filled out the colors.I used the text editor to add the text content to the logo.At last, I selected those basic shapes and grouped them together.
